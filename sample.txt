Hi 
this is for git cherry-pick command
Updated in remote repo and in local repo for checking the updated content
This line is for ssh url added to github repo



Now am editing and commiting a changes, after pushing remote repo by giving a msg, want to edit msg by using a command i.e git commit -amend -m "updated msg".
